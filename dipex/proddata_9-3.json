NATO's fundamental goal is to safeguard the Allies' freedom and security by political and military means. NATO remains the principal security instrument of the transatlantic community and expression of its common democratic values. It is the practical means through which the security of North America and Europe are permanently tied together. NATO enlargement has furthered the U.S. goal of a Europe whole, free, and at peace. \\r\\n Article 5 of the Washington Treaty -- that an attack against one Ally is an attack against all -- is at the core of the Alliance, a promise of collective defense. Article 4 of the treaty ensures consultations among Allies on security matters of common interest, which have expanded from a narrowly defined Soviet threat to the critical mission in Afghanistan, as well as peacekeeping in Kosovo and new threats to security such as cyber-attacks, and global threats such as terrorism and piracy that affect the Alliance and its global network of partners. \", \"labels\": {\"labels\": [\"Member\", \"Not a member\"], \"values\": [\"Member\", \"Null\"]}, \"jsonStyle\": {\" color\": \"white\", \"attributeName\": \"NATOMember_2014\", \"fillOpacity\": 0.8, \"weight\": 1}, \"isTimeSupported\": false, \"issue\": 9, \"subject\": \"NATO Members\"}}]", "revision": 82}}, {"pk": 83, "model": "reversion.version", "fields": {"format": "json", "object_repr": "OSCE Members", "object_id": "12", "content_type": 12, "object_id_int": 12, "serialized_data": "[{\"pk\": 12, \"model\": \"layerinfo.layer\", \"fields\": {\"ptsLayer\": 14, \"keyid\": \"OSCEMember_2014_Key\", \"attribution\": \"Source: <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http://www.osce.org/who/108218\\\">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a>\", \"description\": \"<p>&nbsp;The 57 participating states in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) take a comprehensive approach to security that encompasses politico-military, economic and environmental, and human aspects.

The app offers job search advice that encourages young professionals \\uff96 an influential but hard to reach segment \\uff96 to think about intellectual property rights (IPR) as part of global companies\\uff92 core values and something they need to know and discuss intelligently in order to succeed in their job searches. To create unique and compelling job advice and core values content, the Consulate requested multi-national companies like Google, Hasbro and Harley-Davidson to submit videos from their top executives talking about their companies\\uff92 core values and what they look for when interviewing potential employees. In addition to voluminous written content on job advice, samples of \\uff93good\\uff94 and \\uff93bad\\uff94 resumes and cover letters, the app also features three U. S.
