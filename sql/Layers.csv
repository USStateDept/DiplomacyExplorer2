OFDA also maintains stocks of emergency relief supplies in warehouses worldwide and can deliver them quickly.  After a disaster, it supports programs that give people tools to restart former jobs, provide care to traumatized disaster survivors, and prepare individuals to get back on their feet.  The State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) and the U.S. embassy in an affected country help Americans caught in a disaster or crisis overseas.

The Bureau coordinates with the international community to develop humane and durable solutions to their displacement.   These include repatriation of refugees back to their homes when they are no longer at risk; local integration in the country to which they have fled; and resettlement permanently in a third country.  PRM and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have worked in a formal partnership since 2000 to assist refugees worldwide.
